# Recipe Manager 

Recipe Manager is a desktop Java application that suggests recipes to the users based off of what they have in their pantry. 

In the program's current stage (alpha), users enter the ingredients they have in their pantry and suggests recipes based off my favourite website https://www.recipetineats.com/

I have yet to develop the front end. As I only had three months to work on this project, I wanted it to be backend focused.

The application stores user data through a local database. The main data the app stores is ingredients, as recipes are loaded upon launch.

## Technical Details

The program was developed using JavaFX and FXML. I used SQLite to build a database to store user data.

## Future Aspirations

In future, I would like to:

 1. Design a more interesting and colourful front end
 2. Improve the ingredient adding system, as right now, ingredients have to be added manually.
 3. Make the app compatible with mac and linux
